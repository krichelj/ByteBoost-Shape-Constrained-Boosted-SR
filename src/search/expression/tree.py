"""
Expression-tree abstraction for a candidate correction ``g`` (``sec:boosting``).

The project description treats ``g`` as a finite expression tree over
``{+, −, ×, ÷} ∪ {pow_p}`` (and optional unary ablations). Those primitives are
``C^∞`` on ``(0, ∞)``, which discharges graceful saturation (A6) on
certification boxes once ``F̄ < ∞``. Concrete encodings (gplearn prefix lists,
sympy, PySR expressions, …) are left to students; this protocol captures the
operations DualInterval certificates on ``I_x ⊂ ℍ̃`` and soft scores need.
